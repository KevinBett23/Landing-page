    <p>I decided to take a class on programming because programming has always been a dream and passion of mine. When i got the chance to get to learn in an esteemed institute like Moringa, I could not pass up the chance. I also chose it because it is something that I would like to make a career out of.Programming would also allow me to pursue several different passion projects as well as set me up nicely for freelance work.It would also make my job application stand out from the rest to those who have done IT or Computer Science.</p>
